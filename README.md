# WatchMeScripts

This is an old private git repository when I used the WatchMe application to automate it's alerts using Discord webhooks using workarounds considering the application's limitations.

As the WatchMe program (at the time) was unable to use Python as it only accepted .bat files as the alert finishing, I ended up using a workaround to have the BAT file call a python script to send a POST request to a specific discord webhook, and the audio portion of the WatchMe alert used a random alert file I found that worked perfectly well (removed in the previous commit.  it's been so long and was for private use and didn't know how to remove it from the git history before making this public)

This is now mostly for archival purposes as I do not need to use this anymore, as I eventually changed my setups
